# Introduction
#### What is Funky Trees?
---

So, you'd like to know more about the programs and scripts that some players use to control parts of their builds. Maybe you just want to understand what these players are doing, or perhaps you want to automate some part of your own builds in some way. You've seen and maybe even flown crafts that have fancy automatic features, but how do you make those features yourself?

The answer, of course, is with <strike>magic</strike> **Funky Trees**! Funky Trees is a programming language built into SimplePlanes and SimplePlanes 2, and allows you to use much more complex expressions and logic (i.e. "math") to control various parts and inputs on your build.  Automatic trim, custom landing gear, bomb bay doors, digital HUDs, and so much more - the sky is the limit with Funky Trees!

Funky Trees is a *functional programming* language, which means that every expression is a function that returns a single value that can then be passed as a variable for other expressions. In essence, everything is a math equation, and you get to define what the equation is and what the variables are.

As you can probably already tell (even if only from the quantity and volume of this documentation), Funky Trees can be immensely powerful if you know how to use it to the fullest. However, with great power comes great complexity, and it is easy to get overwhelmed. Fortunately, Funky Trees can also be used for many things that involve much simpler programming, and these provide a good starting point for learning how the language can be used even if you have no prior programming experience.

The tutorials and explanations in this guide assume a working understanding of algebra and trigonometry. Some advanced Funky Trees formulas require knowledge of calculus to properly understand and implement, but this guide is focused on the basics.
