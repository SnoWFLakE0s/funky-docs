# Key Terms and Definitions
#### Reference for terminology and formatting used throughout this guide.
---

In this guide, the name "**SimplePlanes**" is used when discussing subjects relevant to both *SimplePlanes* (2014) and *SimplePlanes 2* (2026). To avoid confusion, "**SimplePlanes 1**" (or "**SP1**") is used when referring specifically to *SimplePlanes* (2014), while "**SimplePlanes 2**" (or "**SP2**") is used when referring specifically to *SimplePlanes 2* (2026).

## Special Text Formatting
An `inline block` indicates that the content of the block is a specific function name, parameter, or value (e.g. `clamp01()`,`Pitch`, `2`), or a specific keyboard key or character (e.g. `W`, `&`).

```
Code blocks are used for Funky Trees expressions.
```

> Block quotes are used for notes and other commentary.
