# Learn Funky Trees

Funky Trees (commonly referred to as "FT" or "Funky") is the standardized programming language built into SimplePlanes and SimplePlanes 2. It provides a powerful set of features that allow the player to create much more complex control and input systems, far exceeding the limitations of the basic "direct control" inputs (Throttle, Pitch, Roll, Yaw, et cetera).

While intimidating on the surface, especially when you first open a FT script and are met with a wall of indecipherable code, the  fundamental principles of Funky Trees are really not all that complicated. Even a basic understanding of how the system works can be enough to help you "read" someone else's FT logic, which in turn can help you write your own.

This unofficial guide is intended to introduce the basic concepts and principles of Funky Trees, as well as some of the methods and logic behind them, to provide a base-line understanding of the system and how it works. It is not intended to be all-encompassing, and the generic examples it provides will not be ideal for every situation. However, these examples may easily be adapted or expanded upon for your own creations.

This guide is written primarily for SimplePlanes 2, but is *usually* also compatible with the original SimplePlanes ("SimplePlanes 1"). Any features or methods which are incompatible with one game or the other are noted as such.

For more detailed documentation and a full list of the features available in Funky Trees, refer to the [Reference](/funky-docs/docs/reference/) section of this guide.
