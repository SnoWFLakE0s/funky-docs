# Learn Funky Trees
#### A general guide about the basics of the scripting language in SimplePlanes.
---

Funky Trees (commonly referred to as "FT" or "Funky") is the standardized programming language built into SimplePlanes and SimplePlanes 2. It provides a powerful set of features that allow the player to create much more complex control and input systems, far exceeding the limitations of the basic "direct control" inputs (Throttle, Pitch, Roll, Yaw, et cetera).

This unofficial guide is intended to introduce the basic concepts and principles of Funky Trees via a series of walk-through demonstrations using an [example craft](./examplecraft/). It is not intended to be all-encompassing, and the examples it provides will not be ideal for every situation. However, these examples may easily be adapted or expanded upon for your own creations.

This guide is written for *both* **SimplePlanes 1** and **SimplePlanes 2.** Any relevant differences between the two games are noted where necessary, but the content of the guide is applicable to both games.

For more detailed documentation and a full list of the features available in Funky Trees, refer to the [Reference](../docs/reference/) section of this guide.
